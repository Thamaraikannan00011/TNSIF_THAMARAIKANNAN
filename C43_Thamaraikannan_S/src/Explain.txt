POLYMORPHISM :
	* having many forms.
	* allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
	* to define one interface and have multiple implementations.

Types of Java Polymorphism:
	i. Compile-time Polymorphism - static polymorphism, achieved by function overloading
	   or operator overloading.(same name but different parameters)
	   Note: But Java doesnâ€™t support the Operator Overloading. 
	ii.Runtime Polymorphism - Dynamic Method, where multiple functions can have the same name 
	   but with different parameter lists, process in which a function call to the overridden
	   method is resolved at Runtime. 
	   
INTERFACE :
	* an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class.
	* An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behavior.
	*
Syntax for Java Interfaces
	interface {
	    // declare constant fields
	    // declare methods that abstract 
	    // by default.   
	}
